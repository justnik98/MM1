## Modeling M / M / 1. Dependent distributions.

**Simulation scenarios:**
*  scenario M / M / 1 (the name is indicated in the legend of the graphs) - the classical M / M / 1 system with independent distributions of claims receipt and service;
*  scenario X / X / 1 (the name is indicated in the legend of the graphs) - modification of the M / M / 1 system with positive correlation. The value of the random variable X of the uniform distribution on the straight line is used to generate the values of the random variables of the intervals between the appearance of claims and service
*  scenario X / 1-X / 1 (the name is indicated in the legend of the graphs) - modification of the M / M / 1 system with negative correlation. The value of the random variable of the uniform distribution of X on a straight line is used to generate the values of the random variables of the intervals between the occurrences of claims, and the value (1-X) is used to generate the service intervals.
